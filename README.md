# Banking System

The Banking System project is a console-based application that simulates a simple banking system. It provides users with the ability to perform various banking operations such as account registration, balance inquiry, deposits, withdrawals, and more.

## Features

- User-friendly Interface: The banking system has a menu-driven user interface, making it easy for users to navigate and perform banking operations.

- Account Registration: Users can register new customer accounts by providing necessary details such as name, account number, phone number, address, email, citizenship number, initial balance, and user ID.

- Login System: The system requires users to authenticate themselves with a username and password before accessing the banking functionalities. This ensures the security and privacy of user accounts.

- Access Levels: The system supports different access levels, distinguishing between administrators and regular users. Administrators have additional privileges, such as the ability to manage accounts and perform administrative tasks.

- Account Management: Users can search for specific accounts by account number or name, view all customer accounts, edit existing accounts, and delete accounts if needed. This feature provides flexibility and control over the customer account information.

- Transaction Handling: Users can deposit or withdraw funds from their accounts, allowing them to manage their finances efficiently. The system ensures that transactions are accurately recorded and updated in the account balance.

- Basic Error Handling: The banking system incorporates error handling mechanisms to handle invalid user inputs and prevent system crashes. This ensures a robust and stable user experience.
